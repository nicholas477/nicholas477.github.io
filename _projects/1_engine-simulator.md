# Overview

I don't remember how, but a few months ago my related videos feed got flooded with engine simulator videos. If you aren't familiar with engine simulator, it's a program that lets you describe engines using markup files and somehow it turns those text configs into a colorful 2d simulation and produces beautiful engine sounds. The creator's video describes it better than I can.

You can do a youtube search for "engine simulator" and see all the [whacky](https://youtu.be/PZ9ynEH9YjM) [shit](https://youtu.be/dMorJRNkWhU?list=PLViptfOL1RMftTKEBjvW-1tejbtFq21Cw) other people have done with it. While these videos are cool and the simulator is incredible, it really feels like it's begging to be put into a game engine. So that's what I did.

I created a plugin that integrates engine simulator into Unreal Engine 5's Chaos vehicle simulation. It does this by adding a component called `EngineSimulatorWheeledVehicleMovementComponent`. The component is subclassed from the Chaos vehicle simulation movement component and is a drop-in replacement for it. The way the Engine Simulator component works is that each of them runs their own copy of engine simulator in separate threads. When the mechanical simulation updates in Unreal, the component passes the Unreal Engine vehicle wheel RPM to engine simulator, reads the torque outputted from engine simulator, applys it to the wheels, and also pipes the engine sound into the game. The code that couples Unreal Engine to Engine Simulator is really that simple, and I go over the implementation details further below.

## Drawbacks/issues

[//]: # it's pretty rudimentary, the clutch simulation built in to Engine Simulator is extremely basic, and it doesn't show the engine visualization yet, but I'm hoping other people will download the plugin and make something cool with it.

# Implementation Details/Unreal Issues

This plugin took about a week or two from start to finish, and most of the time I spent coding the plugin was just doing annoying shit like rewriting build scripts to get Engine Simulator to compile as a static lib, and massaging the code to get Engine Simulator to work with Unreal. I'm going to skip over that stuff. There's other tutorials covering how to integrate third party libraries into Unreal, and heaps of engine code to look at too.

What I am going to cover is how the Chaos vehicle sim integrates with Engine Sim and vice versa.

## Chaos side

Bolting on a different engine to the Chaos simulation side is surpisingly easy. The engine simulation part of Chaos vehicles is almost entirely contained in the function `UChaosWheeledVehicleSimulation::ProcessMechanicalSimulation(float DeltaTime)`:

{% highlight c++ linenos %}
void UChaosWheeledVehicleSimulation::ProcessMechanicalSimulation(float DeltaTime)
{
	if (PVehicle->HasEngine())
	{
		auto& PEngine = PVehicle->GetEngine();
		auto& PTransmission = PVehicle->GetTransmission();
		auto& PDifferential = PVehicle->GetDifferential();

		float WheelRPM = 0;
		for (int I = 0; I < PVehicle->Wheels.Num(); I++)
		{
			if (PVehicle->Wheels[I].EngineEnabled)
			{
				WheelRPM = FMath::Abs(PVehicle->Wheels[I].GetWheelRPM());
			}
		}

		float WheelSpeedRPM = FMath::Abs(PTransmission.GetEngineRPMFromWheelRPM(WheelRPM));
		PEngine.SetEngineRPM(PTransmission.IsOutOfGear(), PTransmission.GetEngineRPMFromWheelRPM(WheelRPM));
		PEngine.Simulate(DeltaTime);

		PTransmission.SetEngineRPM(PEngine.GetEngineRPM()); // needs engine RPM to decide when to change gear (automatic gearbox)
		PTransmission.SetAllowedToChangeGear(!VehicleState.bVehicleInAir && !IsWheelSpinning());
		float GearRatio = PTransmission.GetGearRatio(PTransmission.GetCurrentGear());

		PTransmission.Simulate(DeltaTime);

		float TransmissionTorque = PTransmission.GetTransmissionTorque(PEngine.GetEngineTorque());
		if (WheelSpeedRPM > PEngine.Setup().MaxRPM)
		{
			TransmissionTorque = 0.f;
		}

		// apply drive torque to wheels
		for (int WheelIdx = 0; WheelIdx < Wheels.Num(); WheelIdx++)
		{
			auto& PWheel = PVehicle->Wheels[WheelIdx];
			if (PWheel.Setup().EngineEnabled)
			{
				PWheel.SetDriveTorque(TorqueMToCm(TransmissionTorque) * PWheel.Setup().TorqueRatio);
			}
			else
			{
				PWheel.SetDriveTorque(0.f);
			}
		}

	}
}
{% endhighlight %}

You can see where it passes sets the engine rpm at line 19, where it reads out torque at line 28, and where it passes that torque to the wheels on line 40. Super easy. So to replace the engine, you just have to subclass `UChaosWheeledVehicleSimulation`, pass in the RPM, simulate, and read out the torque and apply it to the wheels. The plugin does something a bit different.

{% highlight c++ linenos %}
void UEngineSimulatorWheeledVehicleSimulation::ProcessMechanicalSimulation(float DeltaTime)
{
	if (EngineSimulatorThread)
	{
		// Retrieve output from the last frame
		FEngineSimulatorOutput SimulationOutput;
		{
			FScopeLock Lock(&EngineSimulatorThread->OutputMutex);
			SimulationOutput = EngineSimulatorThread->Output;
		}

		// Copy the output so we can sample it on this thread and on the game thread
		{
			FScopeLock Lock(&LastOutputMutex);
			LastOutput = SimulationOutput;
		}

		auto& PTransmission = PVehicle->GetTransmission();

		// Sample wheel RPM and average it. It only samples the wheels that are in contact with the ground and not slipping
		bool bWheelsInContact = false;
		float WheelRPM = 0;
		int32 SampledWheels = 0;
		for (int I = 0; I < PVehicle->Wheels.Num(); I++)
		{
			if (PVehicle->Wheels[I].EngineEnabled 
				&& PVehicle->Wheels[I].bInContact 
				&& !PVehicle->Wheels[I].IsSlipping())
			{
				WheelRPM += PVehicle->Wheels[I].GetWheelRPM();
				bWheelsInContact = true;
				SampledWheels++;
			}
		}

		if (SampledWheels > 0)
		{
			WheelRPM /= SampledWheels;
		}

		// Final drive ratio is controlled by Unreal, but the rest of the transmission gearing
		// is controlled by engine simulator.
		// 
		// So we apply final gearing ratio here before we pass it into engine sim. Engine sim will then apply transmission gearing
		float DynoSpeed = WheelRPM * PTransmission.Setup().FinalDriveRatio;

		// Give engine simulator the input parameters for the simulation
		{
			EngineSimulatorThread->InputMutex.Lock();
			EngineSimulatorThread->Input.DeltaTime = DeltaTime;
			EngineSimulatorThread->Input.InContactWithGround = bWheelsInContact;
			EngineSimulatorThread->Input.EngineRPM = DynoSpeed;
			EngineSimulatorThread->Input.FrameCounter = GFrameCounter;
			EngineSimulatorThread->InputMutex.Unlock();
		}

		// Tell the engine thread to simulate
		EngineSimulatorThread->Trigger();

		// Apply drive torque to wheels
		for (int WheelIdx = 0; WheelIdx < Wheels.Num(); WheelIdx++)
		{
			auto& PWheel = PVehicle->Wheels[WheelIdx];
			if (PWheel.Setup().EngineEnabled)
			{
				float OutWheelTorque = Chaos::TorqueMToCm(SimulationOutput.Torque * PTransmission.Setup().FinalDriveRatio) * PWheel.Setup().TorqueRatio;
				PWheel.SetDriveTorque(OutWheelTorque);
			}
			else
			{
				PWheel.SetDriveTorque(0.f);
			}
		}

	}
}
{% endhighlight %}

Since engine simulator is way too heavy to run synchronously, the plugin runs it asychronously in its own thread and does the reading and writing in reverse. First it reads the output from the last frame of the simulator, then it passes in the mechanical simulation input to Engine Simulator, and finally it triggers engine simulator to start simulating *at the end* of this frame. Thus, it'll get the output of the triggered simulation in the next frame. This means engine simulator always runs a frame behind the rest of the game, but I think it's a totally acceptable amount of latency, and is imperceptible in game.

## Sound Output

The sound output from the engine is done separately from the mechanical simulation. Each engine simulator movement component contains a procedural sound output: `USoundWaveProcedural* OutputEngineSound`. This procedural sound output is set to sample from Engine Simulator using `void FEngineSimulator::FillAudio(USoundWaveProcedural* Wave, const int32 SamplesNeeded)`:

{% highlight c++ linenos %}
void FEngineSimulator::FillAudio(USoundWaveProcedural* Wave, const int32 SamplesNeeded)
{
    // Unreal engine uses a fixed sample size.
    static const uint32 SAMPLE_SIZE = sizeof(uint16);

    const uint32 SampleCount = SamplesNeeded;
    int16_t* samples = new int16_t[SamplesNeeded];
    const int readSamples = m_simulator.readAudioOutput(SamplesNeeded, samples);

    Wave->QueueAudio((const uint8*)samples, SampleCount * SAMPLE_SIZE);
}
{% endhighlight %}

Passing `OutputEngineSound` to a sound component in the game world and calling `play` on the component plays the engine simulator sound in game. From there you can apply sound modifiers to the engine noise to EQ it, reverb it, whatever. Unfortunately as of Unreal Engine 5.0.3 you can't use `USoundWaveProcedural` as an input to a metasound, but I think they're fixing this in 5.1, so you'll be able to manipulate Engine Simulator using Metasound ðŸ˜Ž
